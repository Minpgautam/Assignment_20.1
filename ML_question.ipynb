    "In machine learning ,when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship \"overfitting\" occurs.Overfitting is observed when a model is excessively complex . The possibility of overfitting exists as the criteria used for training the model is not the same as the criteria used to judge the efficacy of a model.The question arises how to avoid overfitting. The answer is as: : \n",
    "By using a lot of data overfitting can be avoided,overfitting happens relatively as you have a small dataset,and you try to learn from it. But if you have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on that. In such sistuation,you can use a teechnique know as cross validation. In this method the dataset splits into two sections, testing and training datasets.The testing dataset will only test the model while training dataset,the datapoints will come up with the model. In this technique, a model is usaually given a dataset of a known data on which training is run and  a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested.The idea of cross-validation is to define a dataset to \"test\" the model in the training phase.\n"
